10.0-0.737
-----------------------

This release let you load an generate MIDI files, using the Common
Lisp MIDI library (from Robert Strandh at Bordeaux), instead of
MidiShare, which is not entirely ported to MacOSX 64-bit yet.

This release uses the new graphic model where MCL view classes don't
have a matching Cocoa NSView class.

The text fields, controls and dialogs are not completed yet.


- PW-USER configured by default as ~/Documents/Patchwork/
  This can be changed by adding or editing the file ~/LOGHOSTS/PW-USER
  with a sexp such as: ::

      #.(let ((pw-user (merge-pathnames #P"Documents/Patchwork/" (user-homedir-pathname))))
          `(("**;*.*.*" ,(merge-pathnames "**/*.*" pw-user))
            ("**;*.*"   ,(merge-pathnames "**/*.*" pw-user))
            ("**;*"     ,(merge-pathnames "**/*"   pw-user))))

   The PW-USER directory contains the following directories and files: ::

        abstract-autoload/
        library-autoload/
        PW-inits/
        PW-inits/init.lisp
        PW-inits/config.init
        PW-user-library/
        PW-user-patches/

- when an error occurs in a listener window, the debugger is invoked
  in the same listener window, instead of closing the listener window.
