"Builds the harmonic and/or sub-harmonic series starting with the 
fundamental <fund>. The harmonic series is the series of positive integer 
multiples of the fundamental frequency. The sub-harmonic series is the 
series of positive integer divisions of the fundamental frequency. 

The arguments <numer> and <denom> determine what sample (<numer>/<denom>)
of the partials is taken. (e.g. 1/1 = all; 1/2 = every other; 2/5 = the 
first two of each group of five)

The arguments <begin> and <end> determine the lowest and highest partials
generated. The fundamental is represented by '1' or '-1' sub-harmonics are 
represented by negative numbers, overtones by positive. (e.g. partial
number 7 is 7 times the fundamental frequency,partial -7 is the 
fundamental frequency divided by 7; thus to go from the seventh undertone 
to the seventh overtone <begin> would equal '-7' and <end> would equal 
'7')

The optional argument <unit> determines whether the <fund> is entered in 
midicents, ('midic'), or in hertz ('freq'). If 'midic' is selected the 
value will be converted to frequency inside the function and then the 
output is reconverted to midicents. If 'freq' is selected the entry, 
calculation and output are all in hertz.

When <fund> is a list, the optional argument <type> is used to determine
the format of the output. The value 'seq' returns a list of chords 
representing the partials requested for each successive fundamental. The
value 'chord' returns a single chord containing all the partials of all 
the fundamentals."

  "Receives a fundamental <fund>, or list of fundamentals and returns 
the <nth> harmonic or sub-harmonic of each fundamental. The harmonic 
series is the series of positive integer multiples of the fundamental 
frequency. The sub-harmonic series is the series of positive integer 
divisions of the fundamental frequency. Partial numbers are determined 
by their relationship to the fundamental. (e.g. partial number 7 is 7 
times the fundamental frequency,partial -7 is the fundamental frequency 
divided by 7) 

If <nth> is a list, a corresponding series of partials will be returned 
for each <fund>. If <nth> contains non-integers the returned partials 
and/or sub-partials will be non-harmonic, and correspond to the 
fundamental frequency multiplied by <nth> (when <nth> is positive) or 
the fundamental frequency divided by the absolute value of <nth>
