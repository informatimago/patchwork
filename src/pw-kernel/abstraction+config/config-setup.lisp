;;; User Patch configuration
;;;
;;;A dynamic user library configuration scheme for PW. Each function in a PW 
;;;user library can be surrounded by an 'eval-if-key' macro call which does
;;;selecting loading based on an a-list of user supplied keywords. The a-list takes
;;;the form: ((logical-fun-name1 . keyword1)...(logical-fun-nameN . keywordN))
;;;Where 'logical-fun-name' is a symbol representing externally, in an associated
;;;PW configuration dialog, a function or set of related functions in the user library.
;;;'keyword' represents internally this set of related functions. The following example,
;;;taken from the ESQUISSE library configuration, ilustrates this syntax:

;;; the a-list for configuring ESQUISSE 
#|
(setq *epw-config-a-list*
      '(((sortlist list-min list-max) . :sort-and-list )
        ((unique union intersection a\\b aΔb included? ensemble? compare) . :set-operations)
        ((f-mc mc-f ascii-note) . :pitch-conversion)
        ((approx-m midi-center2 midi-center freq-center2 freq-center midi-av freq-av
                   harm-ser harm-ser-f sharm2 sharm2-f sgrm ring ring-fab plaque-f plaque-fab offset
                   mul-chord mul-chord2 make-len-ch inter-chord distor-m distor-ch)
         . :pitch-ops))
      
)

;;;such an a-list definition should be the first Lisp instruction in the user library.
;;;The user can then structure the library in coherent sets of interdependent functions
;;;that must always be loaded together. The 'eval-if-key' macro serves this purpose, as
;;;illustrated bellow for some ESQUISSE functions:
#|
(eval-if-key (:pitch-conversion

(defune f-mc1 ((freq freq)) midic
  "Converts <freq> (Hz) to a midicent pitch."
  (+ (round (* (log (/ freq *diapason-freq*)) #.(/ 12.0 (log 2.0))) .01)
     *diapason-midic* ))

(defune f-mc ((freqs? freqs?)) midics?
  "Converts <freqs?> (Hz) to midicents."
  (deep-mapcar 'f-mc 'f-mc1 freqs?))

;; ---- midic -> frequency ----

(defune mc-f1 ((midic midic)) freq
  "Converts a midicent pitch to a frequency (Hz)."
  (* *diapason-freq*
     (expt 2.0 (/ (- midic *diapason-midic*) 1200.0)) ))

(defune mc-f ((midics? midics?)) freqs?
  "Converts a midicent pitches to frequencies (Hz)."
  (deep-mapcar 'mc-f 'mc-f1 midics?))

) )    ; end of eval-if-key

(eval-if-key (:pitch-conversion

(PW-addmenu *epw-Pitch-conversion-menu*
 '(f-mc mc-f)
) )    ;end of eval-if-key
|#
;;;Notice that the corresponding menu insertion call is also surrounded by the macro
;;;so that menus and function loadings remain coherent.

;;;The macro call also accepts lists of keys so that a function needed for several
;;;sets can be loaded if any one of them is requested:
#|
(eval-if-key ((:arithmetic :sequences)

(defun foo (m n) (bar m n))

) )  ; end of eval-if-key
;;;The function FOO will be loaded if any one of the :arithmetic or :sequences functions
;;;is requested
|#

;;;Libraries set-up in this way are totally transparent to the user who may simply
;;;load them directly without using the configurer
