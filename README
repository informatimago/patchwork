Compiling Patchwork
===================

Installing the sources of Patchwork
-----------------------------------

0- Install quicklisp. cf. _`http://beta.quicklisp.org/`.

1- Get the sources

1.1- Get the sources of Patchwork with git  ::

        git clone git@gitorious.org:patchwork/patchwork.git

1.2- Get an up-to-date version of informatimago from git: ::

        cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
        git clone https://git.gitorious.org/com-informatimago/com-informatimago.git

     
     The informatimago library can be obtained from quicklisp, but
     Patchwork may need the latest version of informatimago, before
     it's integrated into the monthly release of quicklisp.

     Note: with ccl-1.6 on MacOSX 10.5.8, symbolic links in
     ``local-projects`` are not processed correctly by quicklisp.
     Therefore you should put com-informatimago anywhere, eg.: ::

        cd ~/src
        git clone https://git.gitorious.org/com-informatimago/com-informatimago.git
        
     and just add this path to the list ``ql:*local-project-directories*``: ::
       
        (push (merge-pathnames #P"./src/com-informatimago/" (user-homedir-pathname))
              ql:*local-project-directories*)


2- Edit ``~/LOGHOSTS/PATCHWORK`` to tell where the sources of
   Patchwork are installed, eg.: ::

      ;; -*- mode:lisp; coding:utf-8; -*-

      #.(list
         (list "PATCHWORK:**;*.*.*"
               (merge-pathnames #P"works/patchwork/patchwork/**/*.*"
                                (user-homedir-pathname) nil))
         (list "PATCHWORK:**;*.*"
               (merge-pathnames #P"works/patchwork/patchwork/**/*.*"
                                (user-homedir-pathname) nil))
         (list "PATCHWORK:**;*"
               (merge-pathnames #P"works/patchwork/patchwork/**/*"
                                (user-homedir-pathname) nil)))



Loading and compiling for development
-------------------------------------

1- Launch Clozure.app (AppStore), or any other version of ccl >= 1.7
   (or ccl-1.6 on MacOSX 10.5.8).   You may also launch ccl with slime
   in emacs.

2- (cd #P"/directory/where/are/installed/the/sources/of/patchwork/")

3- (shell "make -C /directory/where/are/installed/the/sources/of/patchwork/ clean")

4- (load "loader.lisp")


Generate the Patchwork.app application
--------------------------------------

1- cd "/repertoire/ou/sont/installes/les/sources/de/patchwork/"

2- make clean

3- make application


The application is stored in a directory on the Desktop whose name
contains the version numbers of ccl and of the system,
eg. ``~/Desktop/patchwork-ccl-1.9_darwinx8664-darwin-apple-13.1.0-x86-64/``.

A manifest file is written to containing the systems used and their licenses.

The generated application is compatible with MacOSX 10.3 and up if
compiled with ccl-1.6 on MacOSX 10.5.8, and with MacOSX 10.6 and more
otherwise.
