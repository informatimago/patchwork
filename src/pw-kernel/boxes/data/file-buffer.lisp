    " This module lets one create and communicate with a Lisp text window. The
new window is created by choosing NEW in the front menu (click on A at right
to open the menu). The new window appears and makes PatchWork switch to
Lisp. To return to PatchWork click on the PatchWork window or type Ã™-1. It is
possible to write in this window, either directly (returning to Lisp) or by entering
data by the input at the left of the module. The connection of a patch at the left
input list and the evaluation of the module  text-win ;also makes a window and
switches to Lisp.

To save data, evaluate the text-win module.

The front menu presents six options:

new     creates a new window and links it to the text-win module
open    opens (selects) the window linked to the module.
open-file       opens a Macintosh dialog box for retrieving a text window to be
linked to the module.
 save-win;      lets one save the current window in a file,
 ASCII ;or  Lisp;       an option that selects the format of the data written on the
window.

When this module is selected the default format is Lisp expressions. In this
case the third option is ASCII, which lets one change the format of the data. If
the ASCII option is chosen, the third option is LISP, which makes it possible to
return to the format of Lisp expressions.

Replace or Add   an option that selects whether adding or replacing data on the
linked window. When this module is selected the default option is Add ,  this
meaning that  input data is added to the end of the window. In this case the
option is Replace .

If the Replace option is chosen ,'input data replaces all previous contents of the
window, and in this case the option is Add .

The second entry of the module  fmat ;(at the right) determines how many
elements will be written per line in the corresponding text window. For further
information; type h with the selected module open. "
