PATCHWORK RELEASE NOTES 
========================

next release
-----------------------

- PW-USER configured by default as ~/Documents/Patchwork/
  This can be changed by adding editing the file ~/LOGHOSTS/PW-USER 
  with a sexp such as: ::

      #.(let ((pw-user (merge-pathnames #P"Documents/Patchwork/" (user-homedir-pathname))))
          `(("**;*.*.*" ,(merge-pathnames "**/*.*" pw-user))
            ("**;*.*"   ,(merge-pathnames "**/*.*" pw-user))
            ("**;*"     ,(merge-pathnames "**/*"   pw-user))))

   The PW-USER directory contains the following directories and files: ::

        abstract-autoload/
        library-autoload/
        PW-inits/
        PW-inits/init.lisp
        PW-inits/config.init
        PW-user-library/
        PW-user-patches/
